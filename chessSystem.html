					<p>This project is a fully functioning two player chess system, with integrated mathematics revision, written in C#. </p>
					
					<p>This was my AQA A-Level Computing project and was the first major independant project I worked on.</p>
					<p> The system is fully object oriented in nature. I decided to teach myself the C# language to code this project, after doing some research and realising it was better suited to the OOP nature of this system. Visual Basic was the classroom taught language at the time (blurgh! :) )</p> 
          <p>By doing this, I learnt a lot about the strength of object oriented programming and the close relation it has to logically splitting a system up into parts.</p>
          <p> I was very pleased that the project was given full marks by the exam board and was awarded the title of AQA Top 50 Project. The project was also then after used as an exemplar for upcoming years. </p>
